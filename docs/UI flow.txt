Main dashboard:
Here is each tab and what should be in the tab.

* Course Selection [IMPLEMENTED ✅]
** contains only drop down list of courses from ScoringEngine GraphQL
** Currently shows all available courses with number of tees
** Selected course is required before showing game settings

* Add players [IMPLEMENTED ✅]
** Allow for adding players with following data:
*** Name, Handicap (HCP), Tees they will play
** StartRound call to save this Round in the database
** Current implementation:
*** Player form with name, handicap, and tee selection
*** Database integration pending

* Game Settings [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ⚠️]
** Have a drop down of all games available
*** As games are selected and applied to the round show the options for that game that need to be filled in and saved to the database for this round
*** Allow for applying options by user
** Current implementation:
*** Game type selection (Banker, Nassau, Skins)
*** Game options not yet implemented
*** Database integration pending

* HoleByHole [NOT IMPLEMENTED ❌]
** Hole by hole view with next/previous buttons
** Allow for entering score for each player
** For each game include any holebyhole information. Example: BankerGame would allow for selecting banker for that hole, number of dots for this hole and any player doubled button.
** Need a way to update round in database as user goes to next hole.

* Scorecard [MOSTLY IMPLEMENTED ⚠️]
** Shows a Golf scorecard for the selected course, each player in rows where players have name and hdcp shown.
** Need to show Hole number, Hole par, Hole stroke index (SI)
** Each hole will show * for how many strokes a member gets on each hole based on HCP. (hardest hole is scoring index 1 so someone with a HCP of 10 would get a stroke on SI holes 1-10. Someone with HCP of 40 would get 3 strokes on the 4 hardest holes and 3 on the rest of the holes)
** Each score both Gross (entered in by the user) and Net (gross score - strokes for this hole). Gross in the field and Net below
** Scorecard will show In to add front 9 holes. Out back 9 holes and total. Net scores show below each Gross score.
** Scores under par will be red, scores equal to par will be blue and scores over par will be black.
** Below the scorecard we need a results area for each applied game that shows holebyhole scoring for each game.
** a way to end the round
** a way to discord the round which would delete all records in the database for this round.
** Current implementation:
*** ✅ Basic scorecard layout with holes and par
*** ✅ Score entry for each player with validation
*** ✅ Handicap strokes display with asterisks
*** ✅ Net scoring calculation and display
*** ✅ Score coloring based on par
*** ✅ Front nine, back nine, and total calculations
*** ✅ End/Discard round buttons added
*** ❌ Game-specific results not yet implemented
*** ❌ Database integration pending

Next Steps:
1. ✅ Fix course loading and selection
2. ✅ Implement tee selection in player form
3. Add game options configuration
4. Build hole-by-hole view
5. ✅ Complete scorecard features (handicap, net scores, coloring)
6. Add database integration for round management
7. Implement game-specific scoring and results
