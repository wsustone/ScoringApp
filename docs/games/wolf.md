# Wolf Game Rules

## Overview
Wolf is a four-player golf game where players compete for points by forming teams or playing solo on each hole.

## Basic Setup
1. Four players required
2. Order determined by drawing or tee flip
3. Wolf rotates each hole (last player to tee off)
4. Special rules for holes 17 and 18

## Rotation System
- Hole 1: 1,2,3,4 (4 is Wolf)
- Hole 2: 2,3,4,1 (1 is Wolf)
- Hole 3: 3,4,1,2 (2 is Wolf)
- Hole 4: 4,1,2,3 (3 is Wolf)
- Pattern repeats
- Hole 17: First player is Wolf
- Hole 18: Second player is Wolf

## Gameplay
1. Players tee off in order
2. Wolf has two options after each player's tee shot:
   - Choose that player as partner
   - Wait for next player
3. After all tee shots, Wolf can:
   - Choose a partner
   - Play as "Lone Wolf" against all others

## Scoring
### Regular Team Play
- Winning Wolf + Partner: 2 points each
- Winning Non-Wolf Team: 3 points each

### Lone Wolf Play
- Winning Lone Wolf: 4 points
- Others beating Lone Wolf: 1 point each (except Lone Wolf)

## Variations

### Blind Wolf
- Wolf declares Lone Wolf before any tee shots
- Triple points awarded for the hole
- Higher risk, higher reward

### Last Place Wolf
- Last place player becomes Wolf on holes 17 & 18
- Gives chance for comeback
- Replaces normal rotation for final holes

### Pig Variation
- Partner can reject Wolf and play solo
- Called "Pigging" the Wolf
- All current bets double
- High risk, high reward option

## Settling Up
Two common methods:
1. **Pot System**
   - Predetermined pot
   - Highest points wins all

2. **Point Differential**
   - Set amount per point
   - Players pay difference to those with more points
   - Example with 4,6,8,10 points:
     - 4 points pays 2,4,6 to others
     - 6 points pays 2,4 to top two
     - 8 points pays 2 to top player
     - 10 points collects from all
