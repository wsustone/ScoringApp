# Nassau Game Rules

## Overview
Nassau is a popular golf betting game that consists of three separate games in one: front nine, back nine, and overall eighteen holes (called the "aggie").

## Basic Structure
- Three separate bets: front nine, back nine, and total eighteen
- Common format is "2-2-2" where each number represents the stake for each game
- Can be played as match play, medal play, or both
- Suitable for individual or team play

## Team Play Rules
- All players use their net scores
- Play off the lowest player's handicap
- Best ball format commonly used

## Pressing
Pressing is a key feature that allows teams to start new side bets.

### Press Rules
1. A losing team can initiate a press bet
2. Press bet value equals original wager
3. Press starts from current hole to end of the nine
4. Multiple presses possible, increasing stakes

### Example Press Scenario
