# Banker Game Rules

## Overview
Banker is a golf betting game where one player (the Banker) plays against all other players on each hole, with the ability to increase stakes through various multipliers.

## Initial Setup
1. Players decide on:
   - Dot limit per hole (e.g., 1-5 dots)
   - Dollar value per dot
   - Banker selection method (rotation or low score from previous hole)

## Basic Rules
1. Each hole has one designated Banker playing against all other players
2. Banker selects number of dots to play for (within agreed limits)
3. Ties result in no dots exchanged

## Betting Multipliers

### Double/Triple Bets
- Regular holes: Players and Banker can double their bets
- Par 3s: Players and Banker can triple their bets
- Banker's double/triple applies to all players
- Player's double/triple only applies to their bet with the Banker

### Score-Based Multipliers
- Birdie: Doubles the bet
- Eagle (or better): Quadruples the bet
- Currently applies to gross scores only (net score option planned)
- Banker's birdie/eagle multiplies against all players

## Banker Selection Methods
1. **Rotation Method**: Players rotate through a predetermined order
2. **Low Score Method**: 
   - Previous hole's lowest score becomes Banker
   - Tiebreaker: Longest putt made

## Example Scenario
1. Banker selects 3 dots on a par 4
2. Banker doubles their bet
3. One player also doubles their bet
4. Banker gets a birdie
   - Against non-doubling players: 3 dots × 2 (Banker double) × 2 (birdie) = 12 dots
   - Against doubling player: 3 dots × 2 (Banker double) × 2 (player double) × 2 (birdie) = 24 dots

## Future Enhancements
- Option to apply birdie/eagle multipliers to net scores
- Additional Banker selection methods
