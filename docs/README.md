# Golf Scoring App Documentation

## Game Rules
This directory contains the official rules for various golf games supported by the application:

- [Banker](games/banker.md) - A betting game where one player takes on all others
- [Nassau](games/nassau.md) - A three-part betting game (front nine, back nine, total)
- [Wolf](games/wolf.md) - A four-player game with rotating teams and solo play options

## Purpose
These documents serve as the source of truth for game rules implementation in the application. Any changes to game mechanics should be reflected here first and then implemented in the code.
